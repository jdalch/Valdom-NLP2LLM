This is where Natural Language Processing (NLP) comes in: it is one of the most popular fields in AI today. Thanks to recent developments in foundation models that rely on transformer architectures, NLP capabilities have has seen revolutionary advancements. In this tutorial, you will get an introduction to this exciting field that combines computer science, linguistics, and machine learning.

    "### Text vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Vectorization consists of converting textual data into numerical representations. This makes it possible to process textual data in machine learning algorithms that typically work with numerical values. Common vectorization techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **One-Hot Encoding (OHE)**: represents a token as a binary vector that has the size of the vocabulary. Each token is assigned a unique position in the vector, corresponding to its index in the vocabulary. In the relevant position, the vector has $1$ to indicate the token's presence and $0$ otherwise. This approach is simple but turns out to be inefficient for large vocabularies. For instance, if there are 50,000 tokens in the vocabulary, one-hot encoding would create a 50,000-dimensional **sparse** vector (which mostly contains zeros) per token. If we need a encoding at the document level, a strategy needs to be adopted to aggregate the one-hot representations of the tokens composing the documents.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bag-of-Words (BoW)**: represents text data as a numerical vector, where each unique word in the vocabulary corresponds to a dimension in the vector space. Unlike one-hot encoding, which uses binary values to indicate the presence of a single token, BoW counts the occurrences of each token in a document. This representation summarizes the document's content while ignoring token order, context, and semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**:is a numerical statistic used to evaluate the importance of a token (word or term) in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It scores a token by multiplying its Term Frequency (TF) by its Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):\n",
    "    * Term Frequency (TF): The frequency of a token $t$ in a document $d$, normalized by the total number of tokens in the document $d$:\n",
    "    $$TF(t, d)= \\frac{\\text{Number of times the token $t$ appears in the document $d$}}{\\text{Total number of tokens in document $d$}}$$\n",
    "    * Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): A measure of how unique or rare a token $t$ is across the corpus. Tokens that appear in fewer documents (e.g., technical terms) are assigned higher importance than those common in all documents (e.g., stop words like \"a,\" \"the\").\n",
    "    $$IDF(t)= \\log(\\frac{\\text{Number of documents in the corpus}}{\\text{Number of documents in the corpus containing the token $t$}})$$\n",
    "    * The TF-IDF The TF-IDF score of a token $t$ in a document $d$ is the product of its TF and IDF values:\n",
    "    $$TF\\text{-}IDF(t, d) = TF(t, d) \\cdot IDF(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Embeddings**: An embedding is a numerical representation of complex data, where each token (e.g., word or phrase) is represented as a vector in an $n$-dimensional space. Unlike traditional vectorization techniques like Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF, embeddings are typically compact, dense, and highly informative representations. One of the main advantages of embeddings is their ability to encode semantic relationships. This means that words with similar meanings (synonyms) are represented by vectors that are closer together in the $n$-dimensional space. There are many technique to efficiently learn embeddings in an unsupervised way, some of the most popular **word embedding models** are Word2vec, GloVe, fastText, ELMo and BERT. **You can find online already pretrained models for these popular embeddings**.  \n",
