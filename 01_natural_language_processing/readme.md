Welcome to the **NLP** introductory Lab session ! 

You will get started with the essential concepts of NLP in the tutorial [`nlp_lab_1n2.ipynb`](nlp_lab_1n2.ipynb). 

If you prefer a cloud-based environment, use [![this notebook version](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://githubtocolab.com/jdalch/Valdom-NLP2LLM/blob/main/01_natural_language_processing/nlp_lab_1n2.ipynb) which runs directly on Google Colab.

All library requirements are listed directly in the notebooks. Let's get started!
