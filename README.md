# Valdom-NLP2LLM

## 1. Course Description
This course presents the foundations of Deep Learning-based Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models. Topics addressed include recurrent neural networks, the attention mechanism and transformer architectures.

## 2. Instructors 
The lectures and lab projects will be presented by the following instructors:

### Fanny Jourdan
Fanny Jourdan is a researcher at [IRT Saint ExupÃ©ry](https://www.irt-saintexupery.com/fr/) working on the [DEEL projet](https://www.deel.ai/). Her research interests include Explainability and Evaluation of Natural Language Processing algorithms.

### Mouhcine Mendil

### Joseba Dalmau
Joseba Dalmau is a research engineer at [IRT Saint ExupÃ©ry](https://www.irt-saintexupery.com/fr/) working on the [DEEL projet](https://www.deel.ai/) and a part-time associate lecturer at [INSA Toulouse](https://www.insa-toulouse.fr/). His research interests include Uncertainty Quantification for Machine Learning and Deep Learning models and Anomaly and Out-of-Distribution data detection.

## 3. Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, the students should be able to:
1. Distinguish between the different NLP tasks.
2. Identify the appropriate model architectures for solving each NLP tasks: RNN, Transformer.
3. Implement, train and deploy the most common NLP models.
4. Evaluate the results of different models and compare their performance through benchmarking experiments.

## 5. Assessment
The only assessment for this course will be a written exam which will take place on March 3, 14h00-15h45. The instructors will provide the students with sample exercises so that they can train themselves for the exam. The students will be allowed a single A4 two-sided handwritten sheet of paper with the notes they deem useful for the exam.

Open-answer exercises will be evaluated according to the following criteria (if they apply):

| Category | ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€  | ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ | ðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜Ÿ | ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ |
| -------- | - | - | - | - |
| Result | The result is correct | The result is incorrect, but not contradictory with the formulation | The result is contradictory with the formulation | The result is not given |
| Justification |The justification is complete and flawless | The steps of the justification are the correct ones, but there are minor mistakes | Some steps of the justification are either missing or useless | No justification is given |
| Completion | All the necessary details for the understanding of the solution are given | Many details for the understanding of the solution are given | A few details for the understanding of the solution are given | No details for the understanding of the solution are given |
| Conciseness | No unnecessary details for the understanding of the solution are given | A few unnecessary details for the understanding of the solution are given | Many unnecessary details for the understanding of the solution are given | We are under the impression the solution applies to a totally different problem |
|	Neatness | The solution is neat and properly organized. The steps of the justification as well as the answer are easily found | Some of the steps of the justification OR the solution are hard to find |	Some of the steps of the justification AND the solution are hard to find | The solution is totally chaotic, looks like a scratch paper, or there is no solution |
