# Valdom-NLP2LLM

## 1. Course Description
This course presents the foundations of Deep Learning-based Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models. Topics addressed include recurrent neural networks, the attention mechanism and transformer architectures.

## 2. Instructors 
The lectures and lab projects will be presented by the following instructors:

### Fanny Jourdan
Fanny Jourdan is a researcher at [IRT Saint Exupéry](https://www.irt-saintexupery.com/fr/) working on the [DEEL projet](https://www.deel.ai/). Her research interests include Explainability and Evaluation of Natural Language Processing algorithms.

### Mouhcine Mendil

### Joseba Dalmau
Joseba Dalmau is a research engineer at [IRT Saint Exupéry](https://www.irt-saintexupery.com/fr/) working on the [DEEL projet](https://www.deel.ai/) and a part-time associate lecturer at [INSA Toulouse](https://www.insa-toulouse.fr/). His research interests include Uncertainty Quantification for Machine Learning and Deep Learning models and Anomaly and Out-of-Distribution data detection.

## 3. Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, the students should be able to:
1. Distinguish between the different NLP tasks.
2. Identify the appropriate model architectures for solving each NLP tasks: RNN, Transformer.
3. Implement, train and deploy the most common NLP models.
4. Evaluate the results of different models and compare their performance through benchmarking experiments.
